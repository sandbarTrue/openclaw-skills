## Security & Permissions

**No API key or authentication required.** This skill uses Polymarket's public Gamma API.

**What this skill does:**
- Makes HTTPS GET requests to `gamma-api.polymarket.com` (public, unauthenticated)
- Reads market data: odds, volumes, event details, price history
- Paper trading is **local simulation only** â€” stored in `~/.polymarket/` as JSON files
- No real money, no wallet, no blockchain transactions

**What this skill does NOT do:**
- Does not connect to any wallet or financial account
- Does not execute real trades or transactions
- Does not require or handle any credentials or API keys
- Does not send any personal data externally
- Cannot be invoked autonomously by the agent (`disable-model-invocation: true`)

**Data stored locally:** `~/.polymarket/watchlist.json`, `~/.polymarket/portfolio.json`

Review `scripts/polymarket.py` before first use to verify behavior.

## Note

This is read-only + paper trading. Real trading requires wallet authentication (not implemented).
